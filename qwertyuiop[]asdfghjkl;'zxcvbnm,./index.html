      it was the result of an all-night session of musical experimentation with
      yoko in john's home studio at kenwood, while his wife, cynthia lennon, was
      on holiday in greece.[2] lennon and ono's 1968 debut recording is known
      not only for its avant-garde content, but also for its cover, which
      features the couple naked. this made the album controversial to both the
      public and the parent record company emi, which refused to distribute it.
      in an attempt to avoid controversy, the lp record was sold in a brown
      paper bag, and distributed by track and tetragrammaton in the united
      kingdom and the united states respectively. two virgins, while failing to
      chart in the uk, reached number 124 in the us. the album was followed six
      months later by unfinished music no. 2: life with the lions.john lennon
      met yoko ono in november 1966[3] at the indica gallery in london after he
      received an invitation from its owner, john dunbar,[4][5] to preview an
      exhibition by an obscure japanese artist.[6] lennon described the
      exhibition as "positive" and kept in touch with ono.[7] two years later,
      cynthia lennon, feeling miserable and increasingly distanced from her
      husband,[8] decided to go on holiday[9][10] to greece with her friends
      jenny boyd and magic alex.[nb 1][11] whilst on his own, lennon called ono
      and invited her over for the night.[8] the genesis of the album came about
      when yoko expressed an interest in john's avant-garde home recordings[11]
      after he had asked "do you want to hear some of the things i've been
      playing around at in my studio?"[12] lennon then played her some of his
      tapes[10] which consisted of comedy recordings and electronic sounds, both
      of which he knew the other beatles would not allow on their albums.[13]
      after hearing the tapes, ono insisted that they make their own
      recording.[10][14] cynthia returned home unexpectedly the next day to find
      them sitting cross-legged on the floor in matching white robes, staring
      into each other's eyes.[15] the "unfinished music" series was an attempt
      by the pair to keep a record of their life together.[11] with ono's
      grapefruit in mind, they had imagined that the sound was not etched into
      the vinyl's grooves but was meant to be created by the listener's
      mind.[15] lennon described "unfinished music" as "saying whatever you want
      it to say. it is just us expressing ourselves like a child does, you know,
      however he feels like then. what we're saying is make your own music. this
      is unfinished music."[16] the recordings that ended up on the album
      consisted largely of tape loops, playing while lennon tried out different
      instruments (piano, organ, drums) and sound effects (including reverb,
      delay and distortion), changed tapes and played other recordings, and
      conversed with ono, who vocalised ad-lib in response to the
      sounds.[15][17][18] both of them had experience in avant-garde music: ono
      had staged various multimedia events in new york during the early 1960s,
      and lennon had worked on audio experimentation in the beatles.[19]
      lennon's longtime friend peter shotton recalled later in his memoir that
      many of the loops heard on the album were made by john and himself in the
      days before the recording.[20] lennon recorded directly to two-track
      stereophonic, but much of the source material was monophonic. the song
      "together", written by george buddy desylva, lew brown, and ray henderson,
      can be heard playing in the background.[16] shortly after the release of
      the two virgins, john stated in an interview that he believed the album
      "can change people", as others "have changed my head, just with their
      records."[21] he then claimed "that's what yoko and my singing is, to
      change it like that".[21] lennon talked about making the album and ono's
      influence on him, in an interview in 1980 with playboy's david sheff:
      "well, after yoko and i met, i didn't realize i was in love with her. i
      was still thinking it was an artistic collaboration, as it were â€“ producer
      and artist, right? ... my ex-wife was away ... and yoko came to visit me.
      ... instead of making love, we went upstairs and made tapes. i had this
      room full of different tapes where i would write and make strange loops
      and things like that for the beatles' stuff. so we made a tape all night.
      she was doing her funny voices and i was pushing all different buttons on
      my tape recorder and getting sound effects. and then as the sun rose we
      made love and that was two virgins."[22] this was john's first recording
      project that did not feature any help from the other beatles;[18] parts of
      the album were reminiscent of later editions of the beatles' christmas flexi recordings.[18]

    <div style="font-size: xx-small; color: aquamarine;   transform: rotateY(180deg);

      You can apply this CSS to the inner <div>:
      
      #inner {
        width: 50%;
        margin: 0 auto;
      }
      Of course, you don't have to set the width to 50%. Any width less than the containing <div> will work. The margin: 0 auto is what does the actual centering.
      
      If you are targeting Internet Explorer 8 (and later), it might be better to have this instead:
      
      #inner {
        display: table;
        margin: 0 auto;
      }
      It will make the inner element center horizontally and it works without setting a specific width.
      
      Working example here:
      
      #inner {
        display: table;
        margin: 0 auto;
        border: 1px solid black;
      }
      
      #outer {
        border: 1px solid red;
        width:100%
      }
      <div id="outer">
        <div id="inner">Foo foo</div>
      </div>
      Expand snippet
      EDIT
      With flexbox it is very easy to style the div horizontally and vertically centered.
      
      #inner {  
        border: 1px solid black;
      }
      
      #outer {
        border: 1px solid red;
        width:100%;
        display: flex;
        justify-content: center;
      }
      <div id="outer">
        <div id="inner">Foo foo</div>
      </div>
      Expand snippet
      To align the div vertically centered, use the property align-items: center.</div>
